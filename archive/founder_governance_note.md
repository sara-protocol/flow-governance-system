# Founder Governance Note
(For Future Stewards Only)

If you are reading this,
it means the system has outlived its founder.

This document exists to prevent a common failure:
the slow conversion of governance systems
into optimisation machines.

## Why SARA Exists

SARA was not created to improve engagement,
productivity, or growth metrics.

It exists because flow-based systems
without governance
eventually remove the user’s ability
to stop, reflect, and choose.

This is not a hypothetical risk.
It is a structural certainty.

---

## What You Must Protect

If you change only one thing,
protect the exit.

Pause and exit are not UX features.
They are moral boundaries.

Any proposal that frames them as
“friction”, “drop-off”, or “conversion loss”
has already crossed the line.

---

## How Systems Fail

SARA will not fail loudly.
It will fail quietly,
through reasonable-sounding compromises:

- “Let’s make pause skippable”
- “Let’s personalise flow for efficiency”
- “Let’s just measure engagement internally”

These are all failure paths.

## Your Authority

You are not here to optimise.
You are here to refuse.

If pressured to choose between
growth and governance,
choose governance.

If that makes the system smaller,
that is acceptable.

---

## Final Instruction

If SARA can no longer protect
human cognitive autonomy,
it should be shut down.

A broken governance system
is worse than no system at all.
